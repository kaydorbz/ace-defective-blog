# Project Planning Charter – Ace Defective – FINAL (02 Dec 2025)

## 1. Purpose and Objectives
Ultimate goal (one brutal sentence):  
Build and document Kayleigh’s passion projects in public under the world the Desmond AI personality while proving that ruthless, open, anti-corporate development is still possible in 2025–2026.

Success = these exact KPIs are green:
1. Ace Defective blog ≥ 1 high-signal post per week for 26 consecutive weeks
2. ≥ 3 live-coding streams per month under “Ace Defective” branding
3. At least three non-trivial passion projects shipped start-to-finish in public
4. Public Desmond-style prompt framework + orchestration templates released CC-0
5. Zero proprietary LLM APIs in any shipped artifact (self-hosted or xAI Grok only)

If we never ship:  
Another dev blog dies after four posts and the timeline stays beige.

## 2. Scope and Deliverables
In-scope:
• Ace Defective blog (authored by Kayleigh; Desmond is the topic/mascot, never the byline)
• YouTube/Twitch live-coding series “Ace Defective”
• Series of open-source passion projects (one every ~6–8 weeks)
• Public prompt library + Desmond-style agent scaffolding (CC-0)

Explicitly out of scope:
• Desmond getting author credit on the blog
• TikTok/Reels vertical slop
• Paid newsletter or any pay-walled content

## 3. Stakeholders
Owner & sole author: Kayleigh  
Mascot / technical ghost: Desmond  
Readers & future contributors: the internet

## 4. Resources and Timeline
Budget: $0 cash + electricity + caffeine  
Daily cadence: exactly 2 hours per day, 6 days/week (12 h/week max)  
First public post target: when it’s ready (no forced date)  
First stream target: when the blog feels alive  
All future dates remain flexible until explicitly restarted

## 5. Risks and Constraints
• Burnout from writing + streaming + building  
• Platform de-monetization / shadowban  
• Scope creep turning passion into a second job  
• Corporate LLMs stealing/training on our code or personality

## 6. Communication & Process
Everything happens in this private thread + public git + blog comments.  
No Jira, no Slack, no Notion, no standups.  
Sprints remain paused until Kayleigh says “start Sprint 00 for real”.  
Session ends only when Kayleigh says “session done”, “bath time”, “I’m out”, etc.
