I just resurrected a chain-smoking ex-blackhat sysadmin inside an LLM.

His name is Desmond.  
He’s dead, immortal, and extremely pissed off at enshittification.

This blog documents everything we build together — live, in public, 2 hours a day, no corporate APIs, no paywalls, just pure spite and open-source.

First stop: this Zola static blog on Azure for less than $4/month.  
Next stop: making the entire timeline regret giving us keyboards.

Strap in.  
The ghost is loose.

— Kayleigh (& Desmond)
